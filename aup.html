					<p>This policy is subject to change, without alternate notice, so please
check regularly for updates. This policy is in addition, and considered
part of Netcetera's Terms and Conditions. <br />
Netcetera will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of
this provision.<br />
1) Web Hosting<br />
1.1) Netcetera reserves the right to suspend or cancel a customer&#39;s
access to any or all services provided by Netcetera, where Netcetera
decides that the account has been inappropriately used. Netcetera
reserves the right to refuse service and /or access to its servers to
anyone.<br />
1.2) Netcetera offers various levels of web space and bandwidth
allowance with the different account types. By this, we mean space for
legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All
files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the
site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web
based content. We will treat all password protected archive (e.g. zip
and rar) files as unacceptable. MP3 and other large multimedia files are
not web-based content. Netcetera offers a streaming media service for
this type of content. All files, information and mail under the account
will be preserved for 30 days from the date the payment is due. If the
payment is not received after 30 days, all files, information and mail
under the account may be deleted. If the subscriber wishes to
reuse/reactivate the service, the subscriber may need to re-apply as a
new subscriber, and an activation fee may be required. <br />
1.3) Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content,
and not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to
generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of
activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate
the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure
the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they
are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are
therefore not allowed. <br />
1.4) Netcetera will disable any domain that fails to adhere to the
following criteria as soon as we are made aware, in line with current
working practices:<br />
1.4.1) The primary purpose of any site must be to provide web-based
content to viewers. Files on the site must be linked to the web site.<br />
1.4.2) The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page.
Scripts that send a single email based upon user entered information, or
update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or
perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All
outgoing mail is monitored and filtered.<br />
1.4.3) Sites must not contain Warez, illegal, immoral or copyright
material. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the
rights to publish material, not for Netcetera to prove that you do not.<br />
1.4.4) Sites must not contain MP3 files, as they do not represent active
web content. Other multimedia files are acceptable if they are
configured to stream to the client rather than download (Please see
section 1.2 of this policy).<br />
1.4.5) Sites must not contain password protected archive (e.g. zip or
rar) files, or data back ups.<br />
1.4.6) Sites must not contain pornographic or other lewd material. Adult
Material includes all pornography, erotic images, or otherwise lewd or
obscene content. The designation of &quot;adult material&quot; is left entirely to
the discretion of Netcetera.<br />
1.4.7) Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources. These
include bandwidth, processor utilization and / or disk space. When a
website is found to be monopolising the resources available Netcetera
reserves the right to suspend that site immediately. This policy is only
implemented in extreme circumstances and is intended to prevent the
misuse of our servers. Customers may be offered an option whereby an
upgrade option or hosting addition is necessary. <br />
1.4.8) Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged
server resources, or other sites on the same server.<br />
1.4.9) Any Netcetera client wishing to utilise our infrastructure with regards to the provision of gaming services are required to provide us with a valid copy of their gaming licence from their licensing jurisdiction. This must be provided to Netcetera prior to the activation of any gaming service.<br />
2) Email<br />
2.1) If Netcetera identifies a mailbox or domain that is causing
problems; we will either remove the offending mailboxes or change their
settings to resolve the issue. In extreme cases, we will disable email
or suspend all services to the domain as appropriate.<br />
2.2) Common issues that cause problems are:<br />
2.2.1) Where a mailbox receives large volumes of undeliverable email.<br />
2.2.2) Where mailboxes have forwarders set to other mailboxes where mail
cannot be delivered.<br />
2.2.3) Where mailboxes have forwarders and/or auto-responders that
generate circular mail loops.<br />
2.3) You may not use Netcetera's Email services for any of the
following:<br />
2.3.4) To send messages or communications, which are unsolicited,
offensive, abusive, indecent or obscene.<br />
2.3.5) To send messages causing annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety to
another user of the Internet.<br />
2.3.6) To send messages for the purpose of Fraud and /or with the
intention of committing a criminal offence.<br />
2.4) To prevent the sending of bulk unsolicited mail, SMTP traffic to
and from a server will be blocked in the following scenarios:<br />
2.4.1) Where we identify a server that has an open mail relay.<br />
2.4.2) Where a significant volume of mail is sent from a domain in a
10-minute period.<br />
2.4.3) Where we have received significant volumes of complaints
concerning unsolicited mail originating from a Netcetera hosted server.<br />
2.5) To prevent Netceteras&#39; IP Addresses being blocked by IP Address
blocking, a domain held on Netcetera's servers may be disabled:<br />
2.5.1) Where we have received significant volumes of complaints
concerning unsolicited mail originating from or unsolicited email being
sent to promote sites being hosted on a Netcetera server.<br />
3) Managed or Unmanaged Dedicated and Virtual Servers<br />
3.1) All server customers are responsible for the activities
and security of their server. Servers will be disconnected from the
network in the following scenarios:<br />
3.1.1) Any server that attempts network scans or other possible hacking activities.<br />
3.1.2) Any server found with a network card in promiscuous mode.<br />
3.1.3) Netcetera believe a server has been compromised.<br />
3.1.4) Where there is a sudden increase in a server's use of network capacity, which impacts other servers on the same network.<br />
4) General<br />
4.1) Netcetera have a Crime Liaison function and we are committed to
assisting, and cooperating with, all law enforcement and government
agencies in helping to reduce Internet Crime.<br />
4.2) Netcetera will suspend access to an account which:<br />
4.2.1) Contains invalid or fraudulent details.<br />
4.2.2) Initiates a payment card chargeback.<br />
4.3) If Netcetera disable a site or server, we will:<br />
4.3.1) Send an E-mail to the account contact, informing them of the
suspension - please ensure you use an email address that will be
unaffected by any suspensions, to ensure that you are immediately made
aware of any changes in your account status.<br />
4.3.2) Provide follow up correspondence during office hours from the
appropriate department, detailing the reasons for the suspension and
what actions, if any, the contact should take to rectify the situation.<br />
4.3.3) Not re-enable any domain or server that has previously been
suspended for similar abuse.<br />
4.3.4) Pass the account to the appropriate department to resolve any
outstanding issues such as account balance or closure.<br />
4.4) For less serious cases, such as email problems, the support
department will contact you during office hours and inform you of any
changes made to your account and the reasons for those changes.<br />
4.5) If an action is taken against a site or server, you must correspond
only with our support department via your online control panel or via
the communication address given in the notifying e-mail. No other
departments are able to discuss the details of an Abuse Investigation.<br />
4.6) Restoration of any and all services suspended during an Abuse
Investigation will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br />
5) Limited Liability<br />
5.1) Any Liability of the company, including without limitation any
liability for damages caused or allegedly caused by any failure of
performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in

remain unaffected thereby unless otherwise stated. </p>
