<h5>Data Disposal</h5>
<p>Netcetera takes data disposal very seriously. Combined with our corporate responsibility policy we will personally shred any paper records. These records will then be passed for recycling by our own contracted cleaning staff.</p>
<p>All electronic media is stored on spinning drives or solid-state media. Should a drive be reused we will ensure the drive is formatted before being inserted into another customer&rsquo;s server. Should the hard drive have failed the disk will be formatted to destroy any data and then returned to the Supplier for a replacement.</p>
<p>Once a hard drive has reached its end of life we will ship the drive to an authorised disk destruction company. This company uses a method certified by the CESG to IS5 standards for destruction.</p>
<p>Alternatively, should the customer be reluctant for this to happen we can offer for the failed drive to be shipped to the customer. In this case Netcetera may charge a fee for the replacement drive. Although Netcetera can handle physical electronic data that has been supplied by a customer we prefer to have all data sent electronically via a secure method like HTTPS, SFTP or FTPS.</p>
<p>Should a customer supply data physically we recommend this be delivered in person to avoid being lost or intercepted. Netcetera does not hold any responsibility should this information be lost in transit.</p>
<h5>Social Media Content</h5>
<p>Netcetera does not control the content on these platforms and we are not responsible for how it is shared across platforms. However, we may share content ourselves and will abide by the relevant platforms own Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p>
